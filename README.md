# ScribbleChat-Server
Server side code for ScribbleChat, using Express and Socket.IO.

The main app is currently hosted at: https://scribblechatapp.herokuapp.com/ (Note: As it is hosted for free on Heroku if it has recieved no traffic for 30 minutes it will "sleep" and take a minute to load next time)

The repository for the client side code that the server serves is found at https://github.com/Balkarn/ScribbleChat
